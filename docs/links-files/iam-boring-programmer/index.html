      <h1 id="im-a-boring-programmer-and-proud-of-it">I’m a boring programmer (and proud of it)</h1>
<p>I have a confession to make — I’m not a rock star programmer. Nor am I a
hacker. I don’t know ninjutsu. Nobody has ever called me a wizard.</p>
<p>Still, I take pride in the fact that I’m a good, solid programmer. One
who works hard at his craft and really enjoys it, even without the fancy
labels.</p>
<p>Yet every week I see a call for ninja programmers, who I assume slice
lines of code with incredible precision. I read about tech rock stars,
who I imagine write functions as beautiful as the “Stairway to Heaven”
solo. I hear people throw around the word hacker (and the associated
hack, hackfest, and hackathon) as if haphazardly chopping something into
little bits or prying your way into an unauthorized system is a good
thing.</p>
<p>And lest we forget about those amazing wizards, who can turn nothing
into something with their…</p>
<p>With such cool sounding names and implied mystical skills, it sure
sounds like these are the archetypes that all programmers should model
themselves after.</p>
<p>But what if, like me, you don’t relate to these labels at all? If you
don’t share the sensibilities of a rock star-ninja-hacker-wizard, you
must be doing something wrong, right? Nope.</p>
<h4 id="real-role-models-the-boringones">Real role models (the “boring” ones)</h4>
<p>I’ll admit it — instead of ego-filled, high-risk, thrill-seeking
badasses who can conjure up magical solutions, I have much lower key
role models. I’m more akin to a librarian, scientist, artist, and
carpenter.</p>
<p>Compared to a rock star-ninja-hacker-wizard, those labels do sound a
little boring. But you know what? There’s absolutely nothing wrong with
that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because when it comes to programming and building great products, I
don’t want a rock star-ninja-hacker-wizard lifestyle. I don’t need the
spotlight or fame. I don’t want to stay up until 4 a.m. every night
and burn
out.
There are no magical spells to cure my code’s ills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, like a librarian I enjoy quiet and order. When code is well
organized, things are easy to find and less likely to break, avoiding a
bunch of noise and heartache.</p>
<p>Like a scientist I enjoy analyzing problems, trying different angles to
solve them, and then sharing my findings. I want to understand how
things work, and I want others to benefit from that understanding.</p>
<p>Like an artist I need to occasionally think outside the box, tap my
creativity, and be able to see in abstracts. I want to embrace
imperfection.</p>
<p>And like a carpenter, I really enjoy building things. Sometimes that
means following a specific plan, and other times you just work with what
you’ve got.</p>
<p>I bet there are a lot of you out there who’ve thought along the same
lines. You see these silly terms used so casually — they make no sense,
yet are often used to describe seemingly attractive job postings. Part
of you scoffs, wondering how the use of this lingo ever got started. But
a small part of you wonders why you can’t relate to being a rock
star-ninja-hacker-wizard.</p>
<p>For those of you who feel that way, I say this — don’t listen to it.
Ignore it. If you see a job posting with those words, run away fast and
far. Relish the fact that you’re <strong>not</strong> a rock
star-ninja-hacker-wizard. You’re probably already a great programmer
doing great work, just without all the unnecessary glitz and glamour.</p>
<p>And whether you know it or not, everyone around you appreciates how much
of a quiet badass you really are.🤘</p>
