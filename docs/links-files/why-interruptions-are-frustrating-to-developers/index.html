</ul>
<p>Imagine your focus was a card tower and interruptions were knocking it
down. If your productivity depended on having a card tower, wouldn’t you
get frustrated?</p>
<p>I heard this analogy from a friend of mine several years ago. I’ve
repeated the analogy for a quick visual of focus and have always liked
it, so I reached out to my friend to see if he had a source.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/asking-for-source.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you’ve ever attempted to build a card tower, you know how time
consuming it can be to balance the cards and control the environment
around you. It’s especially frustrating when your friend closes a door
and causes a rush of wind that somehow finds a direct path towards your
card tower.</p>
<p>Just like card towers, a developer’s focus is carefully built, combines
multiple items together, and can be easily destroyed.</p>
<h1 id="focus-fuels-flow">Focus fuels flow</h1>
<p>Coding requires a great deal of thinking. Some days are better than
others, but the goal for each day is to achieve flow or a state of
absolute focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also known as “the zone,” flow is the mental state of operation in
which a programmer is immersed in a feeling of energized focus,
complete involvement, and enjoyment in the process of coding. Flow is
not a concept unique to computer programming, but software developers
are very familiar with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- <a href="https://www.coderhood.com/15-best-ways-to-achieve-flow/">CoderHood 15 Best Ways to Achieve
Flow</a></p>
<p>Once I’m in flow, I want to keep it that way as long as possible. It’s
not voodoo magic or anything, but it’s enjoyable to be completely
immersed in my work.</p>
<p>Many have different opinions of flow, but a common theme is that it is a
period of time where your best work happens. Take a look at some of the
top results of a google search for “software achieving flow” and see for
yourself. You’ll find: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-017-0621-x">The importance of flow in software
development</a>,
<a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/flow-state/">How To Get Into Flow State | Become A Productive
BEAST!</a>, and <a href="https://www.vegard.net/flow-in-agile-software-development-what-why-and-how/">Flow in Agile
Software Development: What, Why and
How</a>.</p>
<p>The articles relate how flow is a period of time where you achieve your
best work. In my experience, it’s not necessarily when I do my best
work; it may be the only work I accomplish in a day.</p>
<h1 id="building-a-tower-of-focus">Building a Tower of Focus</h1>
<p>Getting to flow requires focus and is a complicated subject. Factors in
flow can range from how much sleep I’ve had, if work is challenging
enough or too challenging, my salary, the company’s vision, all the way
down to if I like my co-workers or not.</p>
<p>To simplify flow a bit, I’ve decided to narrow it down to the process of
gathering context (or information) of a bug in a piece of code.
Gathering context is a long and tedious process. To illustrate, I’ve
attempted to walk through what goes on during a typical coding session.
It starts with building a Tower of Focus.</p>
<p>The tower has a foundation, middle layer, and peak. A simple 3-layer
card tower has 15 cards. 8 cards for the base, 5 cards for the middle,
and 2 cards for the peak. I’ve named the layers “The WHY”, “Trade-offs”,
and “Verify”, respectively.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/card-towers-are-like-coding.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each one of these cards is context for the task I’m doing. I build these
layers one card at a time, carefully leaning them against one another.</p>
<h2 id="base---understanding-the-why-of-the-code">Base - Understanding the why of the code</h2>
<p>The base layer represents finding “the why”, or the original intent. It
is the hardest context to gather, in my opinion. In order to make a
change to code with confidence, I need to discover the initial intent
that went into it.</p>
<p>So what does looking for intent look like? Let’s look at a piece of
code.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/why-so-many-comments.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s pretty obvious there were some things the original author
discovered when writing this. I can tell because they’ve put lots of
lines with comments (lines beginning with //). I’ll start to wonder, why
did they put so much effort into this?</p>
<p>The surprise comes when learning that this code is part of a bigger
picture and any change to it can have unintended side-effects higher up
in the chain. (It’s executed from a spaghetti of methods and is inside
multiple <code>for</code> loops).</p>
<p>If I’m investigating a bug related to this code, I’ll have to digest
each one of the lines. Variable names such as <code>reader</code> and <code>n</code>, the
subtle differences between each <code>if</code> statement, etc. As I go, I add a
card to my focus tower for each one.</p>
<p>I’ll explore tests, commit messages or even chat with the original
author (if they’re still around) to try to understand what they were
trying to do. Finding original intent is more or less like being a
detective in a murder mystery.</p>
<p>Except the above is the exception to the rule. It actually had comments…
What usually happens is I’m thrown into the same kind of code as above,
but with no comments and useless commit messages. I really have no other
choice but to read all of the code to understand it in it’s triple
nested <code>for</code> loop glory.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it’s only lightly tested which puts me at a
crossroad. If I change it, I’ll have no idea if I’m setting a land mine
to be later detonated at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>Do I spend a large amount of time improving the tests or do I just cross
my fingers, test it a little bit and move on?</p>
<p>Each thing I discover keeps adding cards to my base layer of my focus
tower. If the code is even slightly complicated, I’m setting myself up
to build a 4-layer or even a 5-layer focus tower. In this case, let’s
say I only needed a 3 triangle base or 3-layers overall.</p>
<h2 id="middle-layer---trade-offs-and-workarounds">Middle Layer - Trade-offs and workarounds</h2>
<p>The next layer is determining what needs to change or what is broken and
how it can be fixed.</p>
<p>Continuing with the example of fixing a bug, I’ll start diving into
where certain log messages were printed in which parts of the code. A
log message can be thought of as evidence or a record of a program’s
behavior (the blood on the carpet, if you’re a detective). Sometimes
logs show a complete picture, but often they’re incomplete and missing
information.</p>
<p>What I’ll have to do is try and reproduce the bug. I’ll add more log
messages or I’ll use a debugger tool (a way to walk through a program
one line at a time). I’ll add some comments or notes about how it
executes. I may change a variable or two to see how it impacts the
output of the program. Usually by doing these things a few times I can
narrow down or isolate what section of the code is broken.</p>
<p>If I’m lucky, I get a solid reproduction of the bug and that’s enough to
figure out a fix, but otherwise, I need to list out a couple trade-offs
or workarounds. The harder problems can be solved in varying degrees but
it essentially boils down to 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>A real fix (takes a lot of time)</li>
<li>A hotfix (may break later, but is really fast)</li>
</ol>
<p>More often than not, the business is okay with the hotfix to get the
problem solved faster (that’s a subject for an entire blog post for
another time). All of it adds cards to my tower and it becomes quite the
balancing act.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/triangles-in-a-focus-tower.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="peak---test-and-verify">Peak - Test and Verify</h2>
<p>The final layer is making sure it works in production. Production is
just a fancy word for the customer-facing part of software. Best
practice is to add some tests, but sometimes a dry run of the code on a
developer’s computer will do. The important part is to continue on while
the context is still fresh in your head and the layers are still stacked
on one another. At that point in time, you know the most about the code
and how to fix it if something goes wrong.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/keeping-coding-context-in-your-head.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="interrupted-flow---perils-of-context-decay">Interrupted flow - Perils of context decay</h1>
<p>In the perfect world, I would be free to move from the base layer,
middle layer, and then onto the peak with no interruptions. But the
reality is, my day is broken up with meetings or interruptions.</p>
<p>Charity Majors, the CTO of Honeycomb, says it best when referring to why
they practice “15 minutes or bust”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a rapid feedback loop…You have that original intent that’s
fresh in your head, you know exactly what you’re trying to do: the
why, all the trade-offs you had to make, all the variable names, and
everything. You can never get that back again. It starts to decay
immediately as soon as you switch your focus away from it…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Charity Majors, CTO of Honeycomb, <a href="https://youtu.be/5sAJ3N6KNdQ?t=90">The New Faces of Continuous
Improvement</a></p>
<p>Imagine I’ve just spent a couple hours building my focus tower and then
the rush of wind hits. An interruption. I get paged to help solve
problem X and it’s super “urgent” (In Slack, @channel is a way to notify
everyone and implies urgency).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@channel just wanted to let you know that we changed the meeting in
two weeks to Friday. The update is in your calendar</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>@channel so and so just wrote in saying they’d like to try X. Is that
possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they’ve used the signal that an enemy has arrived and war is about
to break out or otherwise known as @channel, I feel like I’m immediately
obligated to help.</p>
<p>I’d say 95% of the time @channel is unnecessary and is a great
contributor to destroyed focus towers. Most things can wait for support
meetings or handed off to a single person assigned to help that day.
Shifts can be scheduled on a rotation to spread the task across multiple
team members (checkout <a href="/">Tellspin</a> as an easy way to rotate @mentions
in Slack).</p>
<p>These interruptions pull me from my work and my focus tower immediately
starts to decay. If I’m away for an hour or more, you might as well just
point a hair dryer at my tower and blow it over.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/destroyed-coding-context-tower.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To be clear, small interruptions for a few minutes are usually okay. I
can return back to my task without noticing. I’d argue, however, even
from a small nudge, there’s a high risk that I won’t bounce right back
to what I was doing. I’ll go off and check my email or view the likes on
my twitter feed. The longer it takes to get back to my original task,
the greater the extent of the decay.</p>
<h1 id="battling-context-decay">Battling context decay</h1>
<p>So what can we do? The most important thing is to be aware that
interruptions aren’t free. There’s probably a reason that your co-worker
put a block in their calendar or has periods of do not disturb set. Be
nice to one another.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’m often my own worst enemy when it comes to
distractions. I’ve compiled a list of things I’ve found helpful for me
to focus.</p>
<h3 id="1-reduce-slack-interruptions-at-a-team-level">1. Reduce Slack interruptions at a team level</h3>
<p>If you specifically deal with interruptions from Slack, take a look at
my tips for <a href="/blog/reduce-interruptions-tips-for-slack/">reducing Slack interruptions for your
team</a>. It talks specifically
about ways you can work with your frontline support teams to help spread
the interruption load across your internal team members. My recommended
tip from there would be to plan for interruptions by setting up a
on-call rotation shift schedule.</p>
<h3 id="2-create-friction-to-your-distractions">2. Create friction to your distractions</h3>
<p>I created a tiny bit of friction by moving my top distractions to
another desktop such as Slack, twitter, linked-in, or email to a
different desktop. Whenever I get the urge to look at those things, I
have to press a few keys to switch. The friction serves as a reminder
that I wanted to focus and works great. I’ve also increased friction
further by minimizing the window or closing it altogether.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/split-tasks-on-desktop.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="3-create-an-off-limits-chrome-tab-group">3. Create an off-limits chrome tab group</h3>
<p>One thing I struggle with is checking the metrics of my business
constantly. To assist myself in this goal, I created an off-limits red
chrome tab group.</p>
<p><img src="/images/link-files/why-interruptions-are-frustrating-to-developers/improve-focus-by-using-tab-groups.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The group contains communities I belong to, linked-in, twitter, Slack,
and my analytics pages. I know to not open the group during periods of
deep focus. Yes, yes, I know, I could close the tabs altogether, but I
have a habit of reopening sites. Keeping them locked up in a group helps
me remember they’re my top distractions.</p>
<p>Another thing I’ve been trying to adopt is strategy laid out by Michael
Lynch of only checking metrics once a week on the end-of-day Friday. He
also had trouble with metric checking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Checking metrics is “shallow work”: it doesn’t require deep focus or
critical thinking, but it feels productive. … Until I broke the habit
of constant stat-checking, I never realized how much space it occupied
in my brain.</p>
</blockquote>

Profit.</a></p>
<h3 id="4-record-context-as-you-go">4. Record context as you go</h3>
<p>The final tip to combating context decay is making notes as I go. What I
like to do is have a bash script in each directory named <code>.zing</code>. It’s
ignored by my global git-ignore so I can place them right alongside the
code I’m working on. Here’s an example of one I was working with last
week.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># Todos:</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># - check if ran twice if it updates the usage for that day</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># - use end_ts for date</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># - use the last-in record</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># - ceil monthly usage 219.002 == 220</span>

./report_to_stripe.rb 05/
exit
../bin/monthly_report.rb 05/
exit
</code></pre></div><p>My <code>.zing</code> file serves two purposes. It keeps a list of todos and notes,
but it also is a history of the last command I executed. When I come
back in the morning, I can execute the script, see the output of the
code, and jump start my day back into what I was doing.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/jewel/zing">https://github.com/jewel/zing</a> to execute the script from vim or
my terminal by typing <code>,z</code>. It’s a handy way to speed up my iterations
too.</p>
<h1 id="lets-build-focus-towers-together">Let’s build focus towers together</h1>
<p>Everyday is a battle to keep my focus tower built and free from the
rushing wind of distractions and interruptions. Working together to stop
unnecessary interruptions is a team effort and if done correctly can
have a huge impact on productivity and increase developers chances in
reaching flow.</p>
