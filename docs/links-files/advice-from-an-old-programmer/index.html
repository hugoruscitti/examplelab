<p>You’ve finished this book and have decided to continue with programming. Maybe
it will be a career for you, or maybe it will be a hobby. You’ll need some
advice to make sure you continue on the right path and get the most enjoyment
out of your newly chosen activity.</p>
<p>I’ve been programming for a very long time. So long that it’s incredibly boring
to me. At the time that I wrote this book, I knew about 20 programming
languages and could learn new ones in about a day to a week depending on how
weird they were. Eventually, though, this just became boring and couldn’t hold
my interest anymore. This doesn’t mean I think programming is boring, or that
you will think it’s boring, only that I find it uninteresting at this point in
my journey.</p>
<p>What I discovered after this journey of learning is that it’s not the languages
that matter but what you do with them. Actually, I always knew that, but I’d
get distracted by the languages and forget it periodically.  Now I never forget
it, and neither should you.</p>
<p>Which programming language you learn and use doesn’t matter. Do not get sucked
into the religion surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you
to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.</p>
<p>Programming as an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to
create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play
with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this
interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not
move. Code goes both ways.</p>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.</p>
<p>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and
get no respect.  People who can code in biology, medicine, government,
sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do
amazing things to advance those disciplines.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this advice is pointless. If you liked learning to write
software with this book, you should try to use it to improve your life any way
you can. Go out and explore this weird, wonderful, new intellectual pursuit
that barely anyone in the last 50 years has been able to explore. Might as well
enjoy it while you can.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll say that learning to create software changes you and makes you
different. Not better or worse, just different. You may find that people treat
you harshly because you can create software, maybe using words like “nerd.”
Maybe you’ll find that because you can dissect their logic they hate arguing
with you. You may even find that simply knowing how a computer works makes you
annoying and weird to them.</p>
<p>To this I have just one piece of advice: they can go to hell. The world needs
more weird people who know how things work and who love to figure it all out.
When they treat you like this, just remember that this is your journey, not
theirs. Being different is not a crime, and people who tell you it is are just
jealous that you’ve picked up a skill they never in their wildest dreams could
acquire.  You can code.</p>
<p>They cannot. That is pretty damn cool.</p>
