<p>For the last 5 ½ years, I’ve worked from home. So except for the
occasional on-site meeting, almost all of my meetings have been done on
the phone. If you
were a fly on the wall in my office during a phone meeting, you’d see me
with my head down scribbling notes while listening, scribbling notes
while talking, and even asking for a moment so I can take more notes.</p>
<p>During in-person meetings, I also try to take as many notes as possible.
I often scribble notes while others are talking, and if I’m the one
doing the talking—or if the discussion is a fast paced back-and-forth—I
try to jot down as much as I can during breaks in the conversation.
Sometimes I’m able to pen a few keywords in the middle of conversations
that I can go back to later (during a break, perhaps) and elaborate on
so as to not forget the most salient information.</p>
<p>But I hardly reference the notes later. I write down the notes to help
me process the meeting as it happens.</p>
<p>Why do I do this? It’s not because I’m a bad listener. I’m just not good
at retaining most of the information I hear. I can process information I
hear on the spot and provide feedback and responses that make sense, but
for deeper analytical thoughts and responses, I need to write the
information I’m hearing down in order to properly process it.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I am predisposed to this type of behavior through the
gene lottery or if it was a learned behavior while in school. When I
didn’t take notes, I quickly fell behind in a class or lost focus as my
mind wandered off to other places. In graduate school, I found myself
taking detailed notes just to keep up. It became a survival mechanism
for me.</p>
<p>My note-taking habits remind me of the tagline from the <em>Field
Notes</em> notebooks by our friends at Coudal
Partners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to
remember it now.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="drucker-on-learning">Drucker on Learning</h3>
<p>Back in July, I <a href="http://ryanirelan.com/articles/absence-of-failure/">briefly
mused</a> on my
personal site about an essay by Peter F. Drucker called <em>Managing
Oneself</em>. I was surprised by how intriguing I found the 55-page treatise
on self-awareness and self-acknowledgment of our own strengths and
weaknesses. Here’s my quick summary of the essay from that post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drucker touches on many topics throughout the book about managing your
own career, knowing yourself and your co-workers. He draws contrasts
between the working life now and how it was before we had a vast
majority of the workforce as knowledge workers. There are a few good
suggestions on working in teams (the book would be a great team
building exercise) and learning to work with your co-workers instead
of just alongside them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important part about knowing yourself, according to Drucker, is
awareness of how you perform and learn. Some people perform better in
situations where they process information through listening. Others
learn and perform better by reading.</p>
<p>Drucker also talked about how writers learn. Because I’ve worked
remotely for years with both co-workers and clients, I spend a large
part of my day writing emails, Basecamp messages and, yes, even code.
Outside of writing an essay or a book, a lot of my daily routine
involves writing. So, am I writer? Yes.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, writers learn and retain information best when they
write it down. It’s not just about recording the information for later
reference. Writing it down is a hack of sorts to help remember, and
perhaps process and analyze, the information that is being discussed.</p>
<p>Drucker has a great anecdote about the composer Beethoven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people learn by taking copious notes. Beethoven, for example,
left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never
actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he
is reported to have replied: “If I don’t write it down immediately, I
forget it right away. If I put it in a sketchbook, I never forget it
and I never have to look it up again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have that same experience?</p>
